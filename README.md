### Hi, I'm Joan ðŸ‘‹

I'm working at [CREAF](https://www.creaf.cat) as a data analyst and modeller,
mostly using R.

I collaborate with the [OSM Catalan community](https://github.com/OSM-Catalan)
(eg. [monitorOSM](https://osm-catalan.github.io/monitorOSM/README.html)) and
with Catalan translations. Learning new things while improving the world makes
me happy.
